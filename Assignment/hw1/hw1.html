            <b>Jerusalem (CNN) - </b>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/16/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-trump-intl/index.html">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>'s grip on power was hanging in the balance Wednesday after local TV channels projected him trailing his centrist rival Benny Gantz by just one seat, following a re-run general election.

            Both Netanyahu and Gantz have vowed they can form a government, even though projected results give neither man a majority in the new Parliament.

            Israeli politics now appears all-but-deadlocked and destined for complex negotiations between the two main parties and the smaller parties over possible coalition arrangements.
            <br><br>
            Addressing his Blue and White party supporters in Tel Aviv a few hours after the polls closed, Gantz struck a tone of measured optimism, saying that an era of "polarization and antagonism" now lay in the past with "unity and reconciliation" being the way forward.
            <br><br>
            Gantz said contacts with other parties to build what he described as a "broad unity government" had already started.
